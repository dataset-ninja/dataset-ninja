  <h1><div class="text-primary-600">About</div>Dataset Ninja</h1>
  <p>Here in <a href="https://supervisely.com" target="_blank">Supervisely</a> we got tired of sifting through garbage datasets on platforms that offer no visualization or insights. So, we built something we needed: a curated catalog of high-quality datasets for computer vision supercharged with:</p>

  - No worthless datasets of 10 images
  - Explore labels and statistics
  - Single JSON format with download link
  - Only free datasets with open license
  - Images, videos and 3D Cloud Points
  - Regular updates with new data

  ## How is this different from other catalogs?
  They have virtually no quality control and focus on quantity, rather than quality. Our goal is to collect only datasets you can actually train production models on and prove it by providing descriptive visualizations.

  ## Why datasets?
  Data is the crucial factor for machine learning, especially for computer vision. You can easily find SotA neural network architechtures freely available for the majority of models, but almost never ‚Äî the data.

  ## I want my dataset to be here
  Yay, that's the spirit! Please [create](https://github.com/dataset-ninja/dataset-ninja/discussions/new?category=new-dataset-proposal) a new dataset proposal and don't forget to attach a brief description, license and download link to your dataset. Take note, that we only post datasets with open licenses.

  ## I don't want my dataset to be here
  Sorry to hear that. üò¢ Send us a message to [abuse@datasetninja.com](mailto:abuse@datasetninja.com) from the email address so that we can verify you as the owner and we remove it in no time.

  ## Are those datasets free?
  Datasets you can find here are mostly distributed under open licenses, but please always make sure to check the corresponding *License* section of every dataset you plan to use ‚Äî some may require attribution.
